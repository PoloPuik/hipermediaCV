The primary user for this CV is a human-resources professional or hiring manager who may be reviewing several CVs in a short time. They expect an immediate summary of the candidate’s profile: essential facts, relevant skills and experience and clear backing to those claims (projects, links). The recruiter wants to find the key info quickly, so the layout and text must prioritise clarity, brevity and visual hierarchy. The design should highlight what matters (name, role, contact, top skills) while making it connects easily to other info seamlessly like experience and education when wanted.Because this is a single-page CV, the page structure must distribute information so that both fast scanning and slightly deeper reading are efficient.

Layout:
Top-left: primary identification (photo, full name, current role). The name and photo should be clearly attributable to me but must not visually dominate the page, they introduce me, not replace content.
Left column: main content, longer text blocks such as the professional summary, detailed experience entries, and education. This column has more room to explain context and results for each role.
Right column: quick-scan elements — contact details, skills (in a sort of bullet format), languages, and a concise “personality” summary. Personality is placed near the top of the right column because it is text-heavy and an employer may want to quickly assess fit into the wokplace before reading the full experience.
This layout balances presentation with efficient information density, deeper content lives where there is space, while the right column gives fast accessibility to the recruiter’s checklist.
I based it in a CV I made with a CV generation website.


Design approach: minimal, readable, and professional, a white + blue palette with restrained accents to guide the eye. 
Palette: clean whites for surfaces, a soft neutral for subtle backgrounds, and a single blue accent for CTAs, links and small dividers. This creates hierarchy without noise and easy to read black text.
Typography: a modern, easily readable font for UI/body text. Using larger sizes for name and section headings, regular 16px (or equivalent) for body copy, and spacing only to improves legibility.
Layout: two-column grid on desktop (left column wider, right column narrower) to avoid empty space and to mimic the printed feel of a CV while remaining web-friendly.
This visual and structural plan preserves the aesthetic used in the Figma, clean, blue-accented minimalism while optimizing the page for recruiters who need speed, clarity and easy access to proof.
